# Developer Diary for "Project 6 - AR Sports"

Name: Simonini, Florian

Team: 6

## Week 1 - March 17-23, 2025

### Tasks Worked On:

- **Getting started with A-Frame**: 
    - reading a basic A-Frame documentation
    - testing some models in the internet

- **Getting information about WebXR**:
    - talking to AI and watching YouTube Videos
    - reading documentations
    - searching the internet

- **Brainstorming with the team**:
    - talking about the type of sport and the basic idea of the game
    - discussing the ways we can add difficulty or variation to the different levels
    - talking about a time plan and basic structure


### Problems Encountered:

- **Getting a good overview of the various technologies**
    - Huge amount on Information about mostly unkown tools
    - Learning how the various technological components can be used in combination
    - Where can I use the different tools?

- **What is the frame of the editing mode?**:
    - Asked myself some questions about the mode of operation(Who should things be done), that we can ask in the update meeting
    


### Plans for Next Week:

- **Build a working programming environment**:
    - linking up all technologies
    - start testing models
    - play around with the tools and see what is possible

- **working on a time plan with the others**:
    - set a final goal 
    - set a time plan for the processing period
    - set some intermediate goals and split up the work in packages
  
### Time Spent:

## Week 2 - March 24-30, 2025

### Tasks Worked On:

- **Team-Meeting**: 
    - building-up a working programming environment -> WebStorm as a main programming spot
    - discussing the different types of sport and working out the target idea
    

- **Warming up with the physics**:
    - reading the theoretical idea of physics in videogames
    - writing some code frames away from the actual game
    - then: writing code related to the project, also integrating AFrame


- **Learning about basic game structure**:
    - understanding and familiarising yourself with the topic of how a game is structured and set up
    - learn and understand how the folder structure works; what is needed; where what has to be located at the end and how it has to be connected so that a runnable game is created at the end


### Problems Encountered:

- **physics in first-person**
    - physics in first-person perspective are more complicated
    - in addition, the fact that the user's input and the throw of the arrow is strongly related to physics
    - tracking the movement seems complicated
    - collision detection must be very accurate to create an enjoyable gaming experience

### Plans for Next Week:

- **Working on the integration and use of a suitable LLM**

- **Advancing the code for game physics**

If there is still time:
-  **Designing an own dartboard**



### Time Spent:

| Task                                  | Time Spent |
|---------------------------------------|------------|
| Team-Meeting                          | 2 hours    |
| Warming up with the physics           | 2 hours    |
| Learning about basic game structure   | 1 hour     |
| **Total**                             | **5 hours**|
